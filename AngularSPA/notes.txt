Angular started out as AngularJS and then Angular 2 was released in 2016.
Angular is made by Google, React is made my Facebook, and Vue.js is from another company
React is more popular in web development in general but the reason we chose angular was because it is
more popular with .NET teams and full stack developers. 
Angular releases a new version every 6 months or so
Angular Long Term Support is 18 months minimum guarantee per release
